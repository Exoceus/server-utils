# Server Utilities

This is a collection of scripts that I have found useful when setting up my home server

## List of Utilities

### `ip-tracker`

This is used to deal with dynamic WAN IP address (i.e the IP address of your router changing if you don't pay for a satic IP). It updates the DNS records of GoDaddy with your machine's IP address.

### `health`

Node.js api that displays system usage and can be used for cron jobs to see if the server is up and its resource usage.
